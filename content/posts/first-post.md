This is my first blog post ever. It's going to be very short introducing me, this website and why I decided to create it.

<!--more-->

## Hello

I am Alexandre Bourquelot, at the time of writing **Machine learning research intern** at **Siemens Healthineers**.

My interests include, but are not limited to :
- THis
- that
- also this

## What you will find here

My goal was to build this website in order to showcase my current projects and maybe write some blog posts about my experiments.

It is also a good pretext to learn about **web developpement**, which I was not familiar with prior to starting this blog.


## Website tech

After looking at the differents options available to me, I chose to use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) since it is very fast and lightweight and allows me to write all of my content in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/).
