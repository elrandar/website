Hello and welcome to my first blog post! My name is **Alexandre Bourquelot** and I am at the time of writing **machine learning research intern** at [Siemens Healthineers](https://www.siemens-healthineers.com/). I am excited to share with you a little bit about myself, this website, and the reasons behind why I decided to create it. So grab a cup of coffee (or a cold beer if that's more your thing) and let's dive in!

## About Me

I am a recent graduate from the École Pour l'Informatique et les Techniques Avancées ([EPITA](https://www.epita.fr/)) in **Paris**, where I studied computer science and specialized in image processing and artificial intelligence. During my studies, I had the opportunity to work on a number of interesting projects, including developing a machine learning model to classify medical images or using artificial intelligence to turn real images into Ukiyo-e.

## Interests

As a machine learning enthusiast, I am always on the lookout for new and exciting ways to apply this technology to solve real-world problems. Some of my specific interests include:
- Image processing
- Augmented and virtual reality
- Computer vision
- Computer graphics

I am also interested in exploring the ethical implications of these technologies and how we can ensure that they are used for the benefit of society (and not just to create killer robots that will eventually take over the world).

## What you will find here

My goal was to build this website in order to showcase my current projects and maybe write some blog posts about my experiments.

It is also a good pretext to learn about **web developpement**, which I was not familiar with prior to starting this blog.


## Website tech

After carefully evaluating my options, I decided to use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) for this website because it is fast and user-friendly. 

I also love that I can write all of my content in markdown, which makes the process of creating posts much easier. In addition to Hugo, I am using a number of other tools and technologies to build and maintain this website, including [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for deployment and hosting.

## Thanks!

Thank you for taking the time to read my first blog post. 

If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact me through the website or social media. Thank you again for visiting, and I look forward to sharing more with you in the future!
